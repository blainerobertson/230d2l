				<h1>Course Project FAQ</h1>
				<hr class="rulestyle">
				<p>Here are a number of frequently asked questions regarding the course project:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt><strong>How can I check the weight of a web page?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Navigate to the page you want to check, then click the YSlow tool (installed in Chrome as part of the <a title="Opens in a new tab" href="../resources/bookmarks.html" target="_blank">Bookmark Class resources exercise</a>). Click the "Run Test" button. Check out the components page for the weight of the page.</dd>
          <dd>A second method is to open the "Inspect" tool in Chrome or the "Inspect Element" tool in FireFox. Click the "Network" tab. Reload the page. Examine the "# transferred" in the tool. These #'s will be measured in kilobytes. You want your number to be less than 400.</dd>

					<dt><strong>What are the usability concepts to include within the proposal?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Usability concepts are those things that make our page content more friendly and useful to a site visitor. We will discuss specific items listed in the <a title="Opens in a new tab" href="/230d2l/resources/usability_checklist.pdf" target="_blank">Usability Checklist</a>, but additional usability items are discussed in the readings from the Nelson / Norman website that appear in the weekly overview pages.</dd>

					<dt><strong>What about the content video?</strong></dt>
					<dd>As part of the course project you have to create a video that you will place in the one of the content pages. The size of the video will determine if it can be delivered using the html video element from your repository or will have to be embedded from YouTube or Vimeo. GitHub seems to have issues with files that are larger than 2Mb.</dd>

					<dt><strong>Can I use YouTube or Vimeo to house my video and embed the video in my web site?</strong></dt>
					<dd>The content video should be hosted on your own website and inserted into the content page using the HTML5 video element, but only if the video is smaller than 2Mb. If it is larger, then it have to be hosted on an external service and then embedded into your site.</dd>
