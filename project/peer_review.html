				<h1>Peer Reviews</h1>
				<hr>
				<h2 id="requirements">Why</h2>
				<p>You may ask, "Why a peer review?", the answer is, "To get feedback and have time to fix errors." This process will give you ideas of things you missed or could improve from three different viewpoints. Take this feedback and address the issues raised in order to maximize your score when assessed by the professor or teaching assistant.</p>
				<h2>When</h2>
				<p>The peer review will happen the second from last class meeting of the semester (Friday of week 13).</p>
				<h2>How</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Organize yourselves into groups of 3 class members.</li>
					<li>Each person will review the site of the others in their group, excluding their own.</li>
					<li>Your project should be as complete as possible by the time the review is done.</li>
					<li>Each individual will review the site using the provided <a href="../downloads/Project_Gradesheet_Template.xltx">grading sheet</a>.</li>
					<li>On the sheet, fill in the developer and reviewer information and provide a score for each item and written feedback for the site as a whole.</li>
					<li>Save the name of the document as the site's owners name, plus "review" (e.g. John Smith Review.xlsx)</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Submitting</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Email a copy of your review to the site owner.</li>
					<li>Submit a copy of each review document you completed to the peer review dropbox in the week 13 module (you should submit 2 individual files).</li>
					<li>Each review is worth 5 points for a total of 10 points total.</li>
					<li><strong>If you fail to participate in the peer review process you will lose the 10 points for the two peer reviews AND your final project score will also be penalized 50%!</strong></li>
				</ul>
