    <h1>Acme Project Grading Matrix</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
    <p>All six course objectives will be assessed in the Acme project. Each objective is valued at 30 points. The specifications listed below apply to all project web pages.</p>

    <h2>Objective 1</h2>
    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - All web pages use semantic elements for page and content structures (remember that div and span elements should be used only as a last resort, when no other semantic element is available). 3 points will be deducted for each missing semantic element.</p>

    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - All web pages are valid HTML5. 2 points will be deducted for each validation error found by the HTML5 validator.</p>

    <p><strong>5 points</strong> - All folders and files (web pages, images, videos, javascript, json, css and any other site file) follow the web naming rules.&nbsp;2 points will be deducted for each naming rule error found in the site.</p>

    <p><strong>5 points</strong> - All web pages have meaningful, content-related titles.&nbsp;5 points will be deducted if any page is missing or lacks a specific content-related title.</p>

    <h2>Objective 2</h2>
    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - All pages are valid CSS3. 2 points will be deducted for each validation error found by the CSS validator.</p>
    <p><strong>5 points</strong> - Page and content layouts adapt as screen size changes and no horizontal scrolling or zooming is required to view content (including images), on any screen size. All or nothing score, if content does not adapt or requires horizontal scrolling or zooming to view the content, all 5 points will be deducted.</p>
    <p><strong>5 points</strong> - All CSS must be written and applied to the site using external CSS pages. 5 points will be deducted if any internal or inline css code is found.</p>
    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - Examine the CSS.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Does the style sheet begin with a "mobile first" approach? (Subtract 3 points if no)</li>
     <li>Is at least one media query present <b>AND</b> used to change content layouts for screen sizes larger than mobile? (Subtract 3 points if no)</li>
     <li>Is Flexbox used as the primary means of implementing responsive layout? (Subract 4 points if no)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Objective 3</h2>
    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - Usability principles from the Usability Checklist (focusing on the five "low hanging fruit" items) must be applied to content in the Acme site. 3 points will be deducted for each missing usability concept up to 10 points.</p>
    <p><strong>5 points</strong> - The uncached weight of Acme pages must be equal to or less than 400k. 5 points will be deducted if the weight is greater than 400k.</p>
    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - The PARC and typography design principles must be found applied to the style of the Acme project site. 3 points will be deducted for each missing design principal up to 10 points maximum.</p>
    <p><strong>5 points</strong> - The visual appearance must be uniform and consistent across the Acme project site. 5 points will be deducted if one of the project site pages does not follow the visual appearance of other pages in the site.</p>

    <h2>Objective 4</h2>
    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - The template file contains all web page components (including navigation) but no content. It is valid HTML5 and CSS3. All or nothing score, 10 points if yes, 0 if no.</p>
    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - jQuery and JSON data is used to provide the navigation links for all Acme site pages. Subtract 10 points if not delivered from the JSON file using jQuery/JavaScript.</p>
    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - Navigation must be fully operational and adapt to screen size. Subtract 5 points for each navigation item that does not work. Subtract 5 points if navigation fails to adapt as screen sizes change.</p>

    <h2>Objective 5</h2>
    <p><strong>30 points</strong> - JSON data is the primary content of all four content pages. The JSON object being used for the content page must be displayed in the javascript console of the developer tools within the browser.</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Use the navigation bar to navigate to the content page. Does the content appear in the browser window?</li>
     <li>Inspect the page, click the console tab in the developer tools, the JSON object should be visible. Expand it and examine the object values. Is the object visible? Is it JSON?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Deduct 10 points per content page that does not use the JSON data for it's content or if the content is not operational or missing from the console.log window.</p>

    <h2>Objective 6</h2>
    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - The Acme project must be accessible using a link on your home page. The project must have a minimum of a home and four content pages. 10 points will be deducted if less than five pages are found in the Acme site.</p>
    <p><strong>10 points</strong> - The content of the Acme site is free of spelling and grammar errors. 2 points will be deducted for each error found.</p>
