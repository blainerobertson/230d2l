				<h1 class="activity teach groupPresentation">Design Principles Assessment</h1>

				<p class="callout"><strong>Note</strong>: Earlier in the week you were charged to spend <a href="mobile_day.html" target="_blank" title="Review the mobile browsing activity in a new tab">24 hours using only a mobile browser</a> for casual Internet use. You were also to have completed the viewing of the <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/principles-of-design-for-developers-2871" target="_blank" title="Open the course in a new tab"> Principles of Design video course</a>. Both must be completed prior to doing this assessment.</p>

				<p>This document will be created through a joint effort of you and at least 1, but no more than 4, other member(s) of the class (maximum group size of 5).</p>

				<p>Each member of your group is responsible for one or more design principles to contribute towards this document (depending on team size). Each team member is responsible to find and capture a screen shot of a mobile web page (<em>this must be in a browser, not a mobile app</em>) that illustrates the assigned principle and writing copy that explains why and how the page illustrates the specific design principle.</p>

				<p>Once the content has been developed, the image and copy will be sent to the team lead who will build a web page that will consist of five sections (each representing one of the design principles covered in this lesson):</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Proximity</li>
					<li>Alignment</li>
					<li>Repetition</li>
					<li>Contrast</li>
					<li>Typography</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Required Content</h2>
				<p>Each section will consist of four elements:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>a clearly stated heading of the design principle and the name of the team member responsible for it</li>
					<li>a screen shot of the mobile web page being discussed</li>
					<li>the name of the web site used in the picture</li>
					<li>an explanation of how the design principle is exemplified in the screen shot</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Template</h2>
				<p>A <a href="/230d2l/resources/design_template.html.zip" title="Download the template" target="_blank">template has been created</a> for the team lead to use to create the document. The file should be downloaded, unzipped and the content included in the template. The finished file should be renamed to represent the design principles assessment. When renaming the template, <a href="naming.html" target="_blank" title="Review the web naming rules">follow the web naming rules</a> from last week's materials. Save the file to a folder that will be used for storing homework in your web site.</p>

				<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
				<p>Once the page is constructed, the team lead will:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>place a link to the assessment page in her or his temporary home page</li>
					<li>upload the design principles assessment, pictures and temporary home page (with the new link) to her or his remote server</li>
					<li>test to make sure the link to the assessment file from the home page and the content (including pictures) in the assessment file are fully operational on the remote server.</li>
					<li>Once tested and working, the team lead will send the URL of the design principle page to each team member.</li>
					<li>Each team member will add the link to his or her temporary home page and upload the page to his or her remote server.</li>
					<li>Every member of the team should test their own site to make sure the link works and that the design principle assessment document is operational.</li>
					<li>If someone discovers and problem, work together as a team to fix the problem.</li>
				</ol>
