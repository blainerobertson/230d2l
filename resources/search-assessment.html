        <h1>Search Tool Assessment</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Last week you built the current location page that requested a JSON object from the wunderground.com web site which you broke apart and displayed the data into a web page.</p>
        <p>This week, you built code to determine which navigation item was clicked on and got the weather data for that location. In addition, you built a search tool to dynamically create a list of locations that match the term being typed into a search bar and created a link for each of those terms that, when clicked, would display the weather information for the location on the Weather Underground web site. However, by leaving your site your site visitors lose interest in what you have to offer.</p>
        <p>This assessment will have you combine the skills and concepts from last week and this week to work together.</p>
        
        <h2>Security Note</h2>
        <p>Browsers are aware of secure versus non-secure connections. Chrome, in particular, will block javascript scripts from non-secure sources. To avoid problems, <strong>make sure all URL's to wunderground.com begin with "https"</strong>. This will save frustration and time as you develop and test your files.</p>
        <h2>The Assessment</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>You will return to your weather pages (which you began working with back in week 5) and create a "search" page.</li>
          <li>"Search" will also need to be added as a working link to the navigation bar or to a tool bar in the page header that will lead to the search page.</li>
          <li>The search page will contain a search bar and, just like this week's activity, dynamically generate a list of locations based on the search term being typed.
          <ul>
            <li>Do NOT use the same search.js file as for the activity, make a new one and use it.</li>
            <li>You will want to use CSS or JavaScript to show the search results until a link within it is clicked, then hide it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Replace the link built in this week's search activity with one that will request a JSON object of weather data for the listed location (similar to the menu activity link you did this week).</li>
          <li>When returned, the JSON object will be used to display the current weather data for the searched location in the "search" page.</li>
          <li>The title and content headings must also update to reflect the location for which the weather data is being displayed (just like last week's current location assessment).</li>
          <li>Thoroughly test your work to ensure it works both locally and on the GitHub server prior to the submission deadline.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Work in groups of 2 to 5.</li>
          <li>Help one another with this week's activities and  assessment.</li>
          <li>Add a comment between the &lt;/head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags of the search page with a title of "Collaboration Team" and then list the names of each person you worked with in an ordered list format. Put your own name first.</li>
          <li>Remember the list is in the code as a comment and should not be visible in the browser.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Submit Your Work</h2>
        <p><strong>Post the new search page to your site, along with any other updated files in the weather site to your GitHub server.</strong></p>
        <p>Go to this week's collaboration board and post the total amount of time needed to complete all work (readings, activity and assessment) for the week.</p>
