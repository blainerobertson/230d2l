        <h1>Search Tool Assessment</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Last week you built a link that was used to request a JSON object from the wunderground web site for the current location. Then, you broke apart the JSON object and displayed the data into a web page.</p>
        <p>This week, you have built a search tool to dynamically create a list of locations that match the term being typed into a search bar and created a link for each of those terms that, when clicked, would display the weather information for the location on the Weather Underground web site. However, by leaving your site your site visitors lose interest in what you have to offer.</p>
        <p>This assessment will have you put the skills and concepts from both week's to work.</p>
        <h2>The Assessment</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>You will return to your weather pages (which you began working with back in week 5) and create a "search" page.</li>
          <li>"Search" will also need to be added as a working link to the navigation bar or to a tool bar in the page header.</li>
          <li>The search page will contain a search bar and, just like this week's activity, dynamically generate a list of locations based on the search term being typed.
          <ul>
            <li>Do NOT use the same search.js file as for the activity, make a new one and use it.</li>
            <li>You may want to use CSS or JavaScript to show the search results until a link within it is clicked, then hide it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Replace the link built in this week's activity with one that will request a JSON object of weather data for the listed location (similar to the current location link you did last week).</li>
          <li>When returned, the JSON object will be used to display the current weather data for the location in the "search" page.</li>
          <li>The title and content headings must also update to reflect the location for which the weather data is being displayed (just like last week).</li>
          <li>Thoroughly test your work to ensure it works both locally and on the GitHub server prior to the submission deadline.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Work in groups of 2 to 5</li>
          <li>Help one another with the assessment</li>
          <li>Add a comment between the &lt;/head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags of the home page with a title of "Assessment Collaboration Team" and then list the names of each person you worked with in an ordered list format. Put your own name first.</li>
          <li>Remember the list is in the code as a comment and should not be visible in the browser.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Submit Your Work</h2>
        <p><strong>Post the new search page to your site, along with any other updated files in the weather site to your GitHub server.</strong></p>
        <p>Go to this week's collaboration board and post the total amount of time needed to complete all work (readings, activity and assessment) for the week.</p>
        
        <h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
				<h3>Objective 5 (30 points)</h3>
