				<h1>Web Usability</h1>
				<p>Usability "is a <strong>quality attribute</strong> that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process." (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">Usability 101: Introduction to Usability</a>)</p>
				<p>The study of usability is extensive and complex. This week we will only introduce the concept of usability and suggest some ways that you can increase the usability of your web pages. Prior to beginning, make sure you have read the Usability 101: Introduction to Usability article listed in this week's required readings.</p>
				<h2>Semantics</h2>
				<p>All through the course we have discussed and used semantic markup. The use of the HTML5 structural elements (header, nav, main, aside, footer, section and article) themselves add to the usability of a web page. Back in week 4 you were provided a <a href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/09/easy-content-organisation-with-html5/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">link to a blog post</a> on how these elements have inherent meaning to both computers and humans. You did read the blog post, right?</p>
				<h2>Usability Checklist</h2>
				<p>Download the <a href="../downloads/usability_checklist.pdf" title="Download the checklist in pdf format" target="_blank">Usability Checklist</a>. This checklist contains 25 items that are useful for enhancing usability, with 5 of the items highlighted in yellow. These five items, figuratively speaking, represent the "low hanging fruit" of usability. This means that they are the ones easiest to do and will pay the most dividends with the least amount of effort.</p>
				<h2>Take a Look</h2>
				<p><strong>With the other members of your learning team</strong>, take the usability checklist and look at one another's weather pages. Look for all items, but focus on the semantic structures and the five highlighted items from the checklist. How does the web site score? If more than half of the items are negative then some serious work needs to be done. If any of the five highlighted items are negative, then the site owner should take immediate steps to fix them.</p>
				<h2>The Golden Rule</h2>
				<p>Remember the golden rule -- Do unto others as you would have done unto you! It applies to web sites too. If you come to a site, you expect to be able to find content quickly and easily, read it without difficulty (despite the size of the screen on your device), view pictures and other media without having to scroll constantly or be greeted with messages telling you to download and install some plugin to see and use the content, be able to find your way around the site and the like. All of this may seem like common sense, and it is, but it is also usability.</p>
				<h2>Keep in Mind</h2>
				<p>There are some issues with usability testing that you may not understand (e.g. Add Expires Headers), if not ignore them for now or do some research to understand and implement them. But, those that you do understand and can do, do them!</p>

				<h2>Accountability</h2>
				<p>As a result of this activity you will make corrections to your weather pages and upload them and/or the stylesheet used to style the weather pages as part of the <a href="usability_assess.html" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">Usability Assessment</a>. This is an individual assessment, but with a team component.</p>
