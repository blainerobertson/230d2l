				<h1>Optimize Images</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>As mentioned in the <a href="create_responsive_images.html" title="Open in a new tab" target="_blank">Create Responsive Images</a> activity, one of the major concerns we have is making images light weight to reduce bandwidth consumption and make the images load faster. That is where optimization comes in. Optimization is the process of trying to find the magical balance between quality and file size.</p>
				<h2>Optimizing Images of Websites</h2>
				<p>This 14 minute video highlights the message that I want you to understand in the first 5 minutes of the video. The balance of the video discusses some tools that can be used.</p>

				<h2>Tools</h2>
				<h3>Photoshop</h3>
				<p>While we are not using PhotoShop, it has a built-in optimization tool known as "Save for web". By using this tool, you can specify some constraints via settings that should help in finding this balance mentioned above.</p>
				<h3>Mac - ImageOptim</h3>
				<p><a href="https://imageoptim.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">ImageOptim is a free Mac application</a> for optimizing images. Download the software and <a href="https://imageoptim.com/howto.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">refer to the developer's "How To" page</a> for use instructions. Use it to make your images more light weight.</p>
				<p><strong>A caveat:</strong> When saving a jpeg image using Pixlr the default compression setting is 80%. The default compression setting in ImageOptim is also 80%. This means that ImageOptim will not reduce the size of an image saved from Pixlr without changing the compression settings to a lower number in ImageOptim. Refer to the video below for a quick demo.</p>

				<h3>FileOptimizer - Windows</h3>
				<p>As the name says, File Optimizer for Windows does more than work with images. But, we will focus on that aspect of the tool. It can be downloaded from sorceforge.net at <a href="http://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.net/static.php?page=FileOptimizer" title="Download the program in a new tab" target="_blank">http://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.net/static.php?page=FileOptimizer</a>. On the same page as the download you will find a list of all the file types the tool can work with and some basic documentation of use.</p>
				<h3>Download and Use</h3>
				<p>Download the tool appropriate to your operating system or use one of the mentioned online tools and optimize your images from the Create Responsive Images activity (optimize those in the images folder, not those in the raw-images folder). The idea is to make them as light as possible while still maintaining their quality. When you are done, you are ready to use the images in the <a href="implement_responsive_images.html" title="Open in a new tab" target="_blank">Implement Responsive Images</a> activity.</p>
