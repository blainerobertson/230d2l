				<h1>Install Pixlr Extension to Brackets</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Pixlr is a popular and free online image editing application - <a href="https://pixlr.com" title="Go to the Pixlr site" target="_blank">https://pixlr.com</a>. It is also available as an extension for Brackets.</p>
				<p>Follow the directions provided in the video and install the Pixlr extension for Brackets. It will allow you to edit images for this unit and in the future without leaving Brackets.</p>
				<h2>PhotoShop</h2>
				<p>The market standard for image work is Adobe's PhotoShop. However, it is also expensive. If you have access to PhotoShop and want to use it, please do so. If you don't and don't want to spend the money to get that access, Pixlr will allow you to perform most common image manipulation tasks.</p>

				<h2>Transcript from the Video</h2>
				<p>Pixlr is a popular online image editing tool. It is also available in Brackets as an extension. Let's install it and do a quick introduction to using it.</p>
				<p>Open the Brackets Extension Manager and make sure you are in the "Available" tab.</p>
				<p>In the search bar, search for "pixlr".</p>
				<p>Click the "Install" button.</p>
				<p>When the installation is complete, close the manager window.</p>
				<p>Restart Brackets.</p>
				<p>Here is where things get fuzzy. The default Pixlr icon that would normally display in Brackets is broken. Instead of seeing an icon, you see a blank. The button is still there and works, just no icon.</p>
				<p>Click the button and Pixlr opens, if you have Flash Player on your machine.</p>
				<p>If you don't have Flash, you can download it from Adobe using the URL shown - https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</p>
				<p>Once Pixlr opens, click the desired option from the menu shown on the screen.</p>
				<p>In our case, we will open a file from our computer.</p>
				<p>In this short video we will crop and resize the image.</p>
				<p>With the image open, the tool bar typically is displayed on the left and the tools are fairly common to image editing programs.</p>
				<p>Click the crop tool and select the portion of the image to be retained.</p>
				<p>Once selected, grid lines appear helping you judge the "rule of thirds" to position the crop for appropriate composition. The grid can be manipulated as needed.</p>
				<p>When satisfied, press your "Enter" or "Return" key. The image is now cropped.</p>
				<p>Next, go to the image menu and select "Image size...". Here you can change the width or height (in pixels) and by default the ratio is preserved.</p>
				<p>When done, click "OK".</p>
				<p>Finally, to save the new version of the image, select "File" &gt; "Save" from the Pixlr window.</p>
				<p>Change the name, select the file format, and if the format supports compression, change the Quality using either the slider or type a number between 1 and 100.</p>
				<p>You will see the file size shown in the bottom right corner, above the "OK" button.</p>
				<p>When satisfied, click "OK".</p>
				<p>A system dialog box will open asking for the destination and giving you the option to further edit the file name.</p>
				<p>Warning! If you leave the default name and location, you will overwrite the original file.</p>
				<p>If you want to preserve the original file, then change the name of the new file or change the location folder.</p>
				<p>In this video, the original files are in a folder named "raw-images", I will store my revised image to a new location, named "images".</p>
				<p>I will also add the width, in pixels, to the file name to easily know its size. In this case, the image is 500 pixels. So the name will be bridge_500.jpg.</p>
				<p>Once named and the correct location chosen, click "Save".</p>
				<p>When done, close the Pixlr window by clicking the "X" button in the top right corner of its window.</p>
