				<h1>JavaScript: Syntax, Variables and Types</h1>
				<hr>
				<h2>Syntax</h2>
				<p>As we have already learned, "Syntax" describes the rules that we follow to write a language. HTML has syntax (e.g. lowercase element names, quote attribute values, ect...), CSS has syntax (e.g. separate property from value using a colon, end a statement with a semicolon, etc...). JavaScript and thus JQuery also have syntax that you will learn about in this activity.</p>

				<h2>Variables</h2>
				<p>In addition, a valuable resource for JavaScript and other programming languages is the concept of a variable. In short, a variable is a small location in the memory (RAM) of a computer that is set aside to hold a value. That location is then assigned a name (a label) and when we want to use the value we refer to its name. <i>This combination of a value and its label is known as a<b>"name - value" pair</b> and is used everywhere in computer programming.</i> In real life we do the same thing. When you want to refer to your spouse you can use a label that you both understand to refer to him or her, such as "Honey" or "Sweetheart".</p>
				<h2>Data Types</h2>
				<p>To make the label more meaningful, we use labels that reflect the value that is being referred to. Again, in real life, if we have a series of plastic containers in the cupboard that hold salt, sugar, flour and other food stuffs we call them by what they hold, for example, "Would you get me the flour container?" or "Hand me the sugar container.". Even more useful is the fact that if we decide that we use more flour than sugar, and the plastic box that up to this point held the sugar is larger, we can swap them. We can put the flour in the larger container and move the sugar to the smaller container. Now the "Sugar container" is the smaller, while the "Flour container" is the larger. Thus the container is "variable" meaning what we store in it can change, thus leading us to the name or idea of "variable" based on what we store.</p>
				<h2>Get Familiar</h2>
