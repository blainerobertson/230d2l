				<h1>Style the Franklin Weather Page</h1>
				<p><img src="../images/course/assessment.png" alt="Activity Logo"></p>
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>This week you <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/getting-started-with-css-2903" target="_blank" title="SitePoint Premium CSS Intro course">learned about the basics of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></a>. Now it is time to put some of what you learned into action. Remember the old adage, "Practice makes perfect"!</p>
				<h2>Mobile Focus</h2>
				<p>Don't forget that we are ignoring all screens other than mobile ones. Your complete focus is to make sure the content of the <a href="franklin1.html" title="Review the Franklin Weather page requirements" target="_blank"> Franklin weather page</a> can be easily consumed on a mobile screen and looks good (remember the <a href="design_principles.html" target="_blank" title="Review the design principles">design principles</a> of Proximity, Alignment, Repetition and Contrast, along with Typography?).</p>
				<h2>External Style Sheet</h2>
				<p>All of your CSS must be in an external stylesheet and hooked back to the web page using the &lt;link&gt; element (just like in the materials for this week).</p>
				<h2>Valid CSS</h2>
				<p>Be sure to <a href="validate_css.html" target="_blank" title="Review the validation activity">validate your CSS</a> to make sure it is written correctly.</p>
				<h2>Get a Second Opinion</h2>
				<p>If you are like me and don't really consider yourself a designer (and even if you do) then it is worth it to get a second opinion. Ask a classmate to look at the Franklin page, in a mobile environment, after your CSS is in place. Listen to what they say. Make changes as needed.</p>
