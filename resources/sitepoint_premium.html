    <h2>Join SitePoint Premium</h2>
    <p>BYU-Idaho has contracted with SitePoint Premium to make their service available to students enrolled in this and a few other classes for only&nbsp;$10 a semester&nbsp;(that is a substantial savings). We will use this service in our class instead of using a textbook.</p>

    <p class="callout" style="text-align: center;"><a title="Open the SitePoint Premium Directions PDF - link opens in a new tab" href="sitepoint_signup_process.pdf" target="_blank" style="font-size: 2em; margin: 1em auto;">Sign up for SitePoint Premium</a></p>

    <p>You&nbsp;<b>MUST use your BYU-Idaho email address</b> to sign-up. You do NOT have to pay anything up front, instead the $10 will be charged to your school account after the initial drop deadline next week. You will begin using this tool the first week of class.</p>
