				<h1>Flexbox Implementation</h1>
				<p>Last week you added CSS Media Queries to your external stylesheet in order to affect the layout of the Franklin weather page on medium and large screen devices. This week you will take control of your page layouts for all three screen sizes using CSS Flexbox.</p>
				<h2>Use Your Wireframe Sketches</h2>
				<p>As always, the final layout for each device type will be judged against your wireframe sketches. If you have been provided feedback telling you that your sketches needed more detail to effectively judge where content should reside it is expected that your wireframe sketches will also have been updated.</p>
				<p>The wireframe sketches for all three devices must be included at the bottom of the Franklin and Greenville weather pages (just above the page footer) as reference when the page is being reviewed for matching your design plan.</p>
				<h2>Mobile First</h2>
				<p>The default styling that exists outside of media queries should accomplish two tasks:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Provide default styling for all screen sizes (font type, color scheme, etc...).</li>
					<li>Provide a specific layout for small screens.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Adapting Layout and Styling for Larger Screens</h2>
				<p>Your media queries should specifically change the layout and data presentation for medium and large screens (maybe even extra large screens). The layouts should now be controlled using CSS Flexbox.</p>
				<h2>Include Hourly Temperature Data</h2>
				<p>Add the hourly weather data to both city pages from the weather.json file. <strong>Make the hourly data accessible on all sizes of devices and if displayed, visible in an easily readable manner.</strong></p>
				<h2>Navigation</h2>
				<p>The navigation links on both the Franklin and Greenville weather pages should now be operational for those two cities. The Springfield navigation item can remain non-operational.</p>
				<h2>Submission</h2>
				<p>The revised Franklin and new Greenville weather pages and CSS stylesheet used to style them will replace the files from last week. They should be accessed using the same weather link that should already exist on your temporary home page. Be sure to test the operation of the links and the weather pages in a variety of devices (or device emulators) once the files are uploaded to your web site.</p>
				<p><strong>It is strongly recommended that you exchange formative grading with other members of the class prior to the actual assessment in order to catch and correct problems. This exchange can be coordinated in-class or using the collaboration board.</strong></p>
				<h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
				<p>Objectives 1, 2 and 4 are assessed in this week's work.</p>
