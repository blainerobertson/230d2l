				<h1>Homework Page</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Up to this point in the course the temporary home page has held all links to assessments. With the course project taking over your hosting account as the primary content of the site, the links to assessments must be moved.</p>
				<h2>Create (if needed) a Homework Folder</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>If you do not already have a folder where all homework is stored, create one.</li>
					<li>Be sure to follow the web naming rules.</li>
					<li>Move all files and folders containing previous homework assessments to this new folder.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Create a Homework Page</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Using the same page template and styling that you are using for your course project, create a new web page.</li>
					<li>It should be stored in the homework folder and have an appropriate name, following the web naming rules.</li>
					<li>It should have a meaningful, content-related title.</li>
					<li>The links that previously existed in the temporary home page should now be placed into this new page.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Link to the Homework Page</h2>
				<p>In the footer of your course project home page, located at the root of your site, create a link to the homework page.</p>
				<h2>Test, Test, Test</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Make sure the link from the home page to the homework page works.</li>
					<li>Make sure the links from the homework page to the assessments work.</li>
					<li>Make sure the assessments continue to work (adjust as needed until they do!)</li>
				</ol>
