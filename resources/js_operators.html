				<h1>JavaScript: Operators and Conditional Statements</h1>
				<hr>
				<h2>Operators</h2>
				<p>In our early days of learning arithmetic we were introduced to operators (e.g. +, -, x, etc...). Each operator did something different based on the numbers located on either side of it. JavaScript and all other programming languages have operators as well. In this activity you are to become familiar with some of these, in particular I would like you to focus on the "Assignment operator", the "Equality Operator" and the "Concatenation Operator".</p>
				<h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
				<p>You get up on a Saturday morning and you don't have any homework due ("Yes, I realize that this is a made up situation") so you ask yourself, "What do I want to do today?" Then, as you run through a series of possibilities, "Go shopping?", "Take a nap?" or "Visit friends?", you decide "Yes or No". Each of these decisions is a control statement. It "controls" the action that will take place and it is always a simple "Yes or No" test.</p>
				<p>Every programming language also has conditional statements, called "control structures" or "flow control structures" that it uses to do the same thing, decide what it is supposed to do, and it always is a simple "Yes or No" test. I want you to learn about these, particularly the "If - Else" test.</p>
				<h2>Get Familiar</h2>
				<p>Using the resources listed below, watch, read and explore to make sure you gain an understanding of JavaScript operators and conditional statements.</p>
