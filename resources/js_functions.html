				<h1>JavaScript: Functions</h1>
				<hr>
				<h2>Functions</h2>
				<p>Functions are processes that perform a task. Think about how you shower (hey, it's a clean topic). Chances are pretty good that you follow the same routine: 1) turn on water, 2) wash hair, 3) wash body, 4) turn off water, 5) get towel, 6) dry off. Or, when you order fast food using the drive thru: 1) get in line, 2) pull up until you can read the menu, 3) wait for worker to ask for your order, 4) give order, 5) pull forward and pay, 6) pick up food, 7) leave the line, 8) find a place to eat your meal (you really don't drive and eat at the same time do you?!).</p>
				<p>See, we are surrounded by processes. A function is just bundled up so we can "call" it to do our task whenever we need that task to be done. Functions are useful because they allow us to write the code for the task once and use it many times, always in the same way.</p>
				<h2>Get Familiar</h2>
