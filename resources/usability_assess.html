				<h1>Usability Check: Weather Pages</h1>
				<p>This week you were to do the <a href="web_usability.html" target="_blank" title="Refer to the Usability activity">Web Usability</a>&nbsp;activity with other members of your learning group and look through the two weather pages using the <a href="../downloads/usability_checklist.pdf" title="Download the checklist in PDF format" target="_blank">Usability Checklist</a>. If you did that activity, you should be aware of things that were overlooked as you built the Franklin and Greenville weather pages.</p>
				<h2>Implement</h2>
				<p>Based on the identified problems from your group activity you are to fix them. The focus of this assessment is on the use of semantics, design principles and items in the usability checklist, starting with the five "low hanging fruit" highlighted in yellow in the checklist. Add or correct the appropriate markup or styles to the two weather pages to insure that the usability items mentioned are now in place and functional.</p>
				<h2>Keep In Mind</h2>
				<p>This assessment is a trial run for your site project assessment that will occur at semester's end.</p>
				<h2>Submission</h2>
				<p>Unline previous weeks where you uploaded new files, this week you will make corrections to the Franklin and/or Greenville weather pages and/or the stylesheet used to style these weather pages to enhance the usability of the pages.</p>
				<p>Once the corrections or alterations are finished you will upload the new versions of the files to your site. You should not have to change any existing links on your site. The same links that worked before should continue to work.</p>
