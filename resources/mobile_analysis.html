				<h1 class="activity ponder practiceApply">Mobile Visitor Analysis and Persona</h1>
				<div class="callout"><strong>Note</strong>: You should have completed your <a href="mobile_day.html" target="_blank" title="Review the activity in a new tab">24 hour mobile browsing experience</a> prior to undertaking this assessment and completed the assigned readings for this week.</div>

				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>This assessment asks you to do a visitor analysis for a particular web site that you visited during your mobile browsing exercise (the site you thought did the best job is recommended). In addition to the visitor analysis you will develop a Persona representing a typical site visitor. You should use the&nbsp;<a href="visitor_considerations.html" title="Review the visitor considerations guide" target="_blank">Visitor Consideration</a>&nbsp;file to guide you in the Visitor Analysis section and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">Persona reading</a> to guide you as you develop the Persona for your chosen web site.
				</p>

				<p><i>Why are you doing this?</i>&nbsp;The intent is to get you thinking critically about who we build web sites for? &nbsp;The people who visit the site, not ourselves! By doing this, the hope is that when it comes time for you to build your own site, you will keep in mind who you are building it for and how you can best meet their needs.</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Develop a web page that you will post to your web site. You may <a href="visitor_analysis_persona.html.zip" title="Download and unzip the template for your use" target="_blank">use this template</a> if you wish.</li>
					<li>Pick a web site that you believe provided a good visitor experience.</li>
					<li>Clearly state the name of the site and provide the URL to the site.</li>
					<li>There should be two sections: Visitor Analysis and Persona (clearly label each section).</li>
					<li>For the Visitor Analysis section do the following:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Address each item in the Visitor Consideration document for your chosen site.</li>
						<li>Provide adequate detail to demonstrate that you have carefully thought about how the site is considering and meeting the needs of the site audience and visitors.</li>
						<li>Include screenshots from the page you think did a great job and explain why.</li>
					</ol>
					<li>For the Persona section, include the following:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>All of the items represented in the&nbsp;<i>Example Persona</i>&nbsp;found in the Persona reading (including a picture).
						</li>
						<li>For the quote, provide a task or question that the persona would try to accomplish or ask while visiting the web site.</li>
					</ol>
				</ol>

				<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

				<ol>
					<li>Save the web page your web site in a folder specifically for homework (you may need to create this folder if it doesn't yet exist - remember the naming rules).</li>
					<li>Upload the file and the folder to your production web site.</li>
					<li>Add a link to the analysis file in the temporary home page of your web site.</li>
					<li>Upload the changed temporary home page to your web site.</li>
					<li>Open your home page in a browser and make sure the link to the analysis file works.</li>
					<ol>
						<li>If the link doesn't work, do some troubleshooting or get help until it does.</li>
					</ol>
				</ol>

				<h2 class="activity teach peerFeedback">Submitting for Peer Review</h2>
				<p>After you post the web page to your website, post a link to the file to this week's collaboration board.</p>
				<p>In addition to posting your link, you need to review and give feedback on the analysis page of the people in your learning group.</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<p><strong>Assignment Grade Breakdown (5 points total) - Objective 6</strong></p>
					<ul>
