				<h1>Mobile Site Visitor Analysis</h1>
				<div class="callout"><strong>Note</strong>: You should have completed your <a href="mobile_day.html" target="_blank" title="Review the activity in a new tab">24 hour mobile browsing experience</a> prior to undertaking this assessment and completed the assigned readings for this week.</div>

				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<p>This assessment asks you to do three things as you consider the web site that you believe did the very best job of meeting your needs as you used the Internet during your mobile browsing exercise. The three considerations are:</p>
				<h3 id="audience">Target Audience</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>What are their demographics? Age, Income, Education, Geographic Location.</li>
					<li>How did the site meet the needs of the visitor (be specific in terms of "<a href="visitor_considerations.html#principles" title="Opens in a new tab" target="_blank">Less is More</a>)?</li>
					<li>Describe how the content was organized to facilitate it being found.</li>
					<li>What did the site to make the mobile experience enjoyable (or at least not painful)?</li>
					<li>Did the site seem to facilitate people in a mobile environment (Think about the descriptions in the Visitor Considerations reading)? If "Yes", how?</li>
				</ol>

				<h3 id="persona">Persona</h3>
				<p>Develop a <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">Persona</a> representing a typical site visitor.</p>

				<h3 id="contrast">Site Contrast</h3>
				<p>Contrast, from a site visitor point of view, the worst site you found from the best site. Provide a short written description to each of the questions below, not just a "Yes" or "No":</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Did they or did they not know who their target audience was?</li>
					<li>Did they or did they not meet the needs of their audience?</li>
					<li>Did they or did they not organize content to facilitate it being found?</li>
					<li>Did the site facilitate visitors in a mobile environment?</li>
				</ol>


				<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
				<p>The intent is to get you thinking critically about who we build web sites for? The people who visit the site, not ourselves! By doing this, the hope is that when it comes time for you to build your own site, you will keep in mind who you are building it for and how you can best meet their needs.</p>

				<h2>Requirements</h2>
				<h3>Identify the Site</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Develop a web page that you will post to your web site. You may <a href="visitor_analysis_persona.html.zip" title="Download and unzip the template for your use" target="_blank">use this template</a> if you wish.</li>
					<li>Pick a web site that you believe provided a very good visitor experience.</li>
					<li>Clearly state the name of the site and provide the URL to the site.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Required Sections</h3>
				<p>There should be three sections: Target Audience, Persona and Site Contrast (clearly label each section).</p>

				<h4>Target Audience</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Address each of the items listed in the <a href="#audience">Target Audience instructions</a> above.</li>
					<li>Include a screenshot of a page from the site that you think did a great job of meeting the visitor needs and explain why.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Persona</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>All of the items represented in the <i>Example Persona</i> found in the <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">Persona</a> reading (including a picture).
					</li>
					<li>For the quote, provide a task or question that the persona would try to accomplish or ask while visiting the web site.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Site Contrast</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Address each of the items listed in the <a href="#contrast">Site Contrast instructions</a> above.</li>
					<li>Include the name and url of the site you believe did a poor job of meeting the visitor's needs.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

				<ol>
					<li>Save the web page to your web site in a folder specifically for homework (you may need to create this folder if it doesn't yet exist - remember the naming rules).</li>
					<li>Upload the file and the folder to your production web site.</li>
					<li>Add a link to the analysis file in the temporary home page of your web site.</li>
					<li>Upload the changed temporary home page to your web site.</li>
					<li>Open your home page in a browser and make sure the link to the analysis file works.</li>
					<ol>
						<li>If the link doesn't work, do some troubleshooting or get help until it does.</li>
					</ol>
				</ol>

				<h2>Grading Matrix</h2>

					<p>Objective 3 (5 points)</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The best and worst site are clearly identified by name and URL - 1 point</li>
						<li>The Target Audience section is complete and contains adequate detail to describe each required element (including screen capture) - 1 point.</li>
						<li>The Persona section is complete and contains adequate detail to describe the persona (including picture) - 1 point.</li>
						<li>The Site Contrast section is complete and contains adequate detail to describe each required element - 1 point.</li>
						<li>The images (screen capture for Target audience section and persona picture) display properly in the document - 1 point.</li>
					</ul>
