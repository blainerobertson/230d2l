				<hr />
				<div><img src="../images/course/assessment.png" alt="Assessment logo" title="Assessment logo"></div>
				<p>Due Saturday of Week 04 by 11:30pm, local time</p>
				<p>Last week you learned about developing a purpose statement, focusing on the needs of users, persona development and principles of design and had opportunity to examine mobile web sites and collaborate in a team situation to accomplish a task.</p>
				<p>This week we added the concept of sketching wireframes to the planning process and we have begun learning how to write HTML.</p>
				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Beginning today we will be working on a website to provide weather information for three cities. You are to produce the initial planning document describing the site purpose, target audience, a persona to represent a member of the audience and produce sketches for how the data will be laid out on the screen for three device sizes (small, medium and large screens). You will build a web page, include all of the components mentioned into the document and post it to your web site with a link to the document in the footer of your home page.</p>

				<h2>Tasks</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Develop a site purpose statement based on the activities from last week and submit it as part of the planning page (due Saturday).</li>
					<li>Develop an Audience description using the document from last week and submit it as part of the planning page (due Saturday).</li>
					<li>Develop an audience Persona using the <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html" target="_blank" title="Persona on usability.gov - opens in a new tab">Persona materials</a> from last week and submit it as part of the planning page (due Saturday).</li>
					<li>Produce three sketches for small, medium and large screen devices using the <a href="../downloads/templates.zip" title="Download the zip file of templates" target="_blank">provided device templates</a> (if desired).</li>
					<li><strong>Peer Review:</strong> When done, have at least one other member of the class review your document and provide feedback.
						<ul>
							<li>Revise the document (including sketches) as needed, taking the peer review into consideration. You will be accountable for reporting the peer feedback and your response to it.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
