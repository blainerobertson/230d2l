				<h1>Weather.json Review</h1>
				<hr>
				<h2>Understand the Structure</h2>
				<p>Hopefully, over the past two weeks you have come to understand that curly braces "{}" are used to represent JavaScript objects.</p>

				<p>What you may not have realized is that objects within object, such as:</p>

				<p><code>{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Franklin": {<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "City": "Franklin",<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "State" : "ID",<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "High": 90,<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; },</code></p>
				<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Greenville": {<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "City": "Greenville",<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "State" : "SC",<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "High": 84,<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; },</code></p>
				<p><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Springfield": {<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "City": "Springfield",<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "State" : "IL",<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "High": 77,<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
					&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>
					&nbsp;}</code></p>

				<p>are "<i><b>array-like</b></i>". This means they are not true arrays, but they can be treated as if they were. For example, if our object were assigned to a variable:</p>
				<p><b>var data = {"Franklin":{...},"Greenville":{...},"Springfield":{...}};</b></p>
				<p>We could access all of the Greenville object's data by using data[Greenville], this mimics the array-like syntax.</p>
				<p>If we were to use regular javaScript object syntax we could just use the regular dot notation (e.g. data.Greenville).</p>

				<h2>Mix and Match</h2>
				<p>But what is really cool is that you can (doesn't mean you should) mix and match syntax. For example, to get the high for Springfield you could use:</p>
				<p><strong>var high = data[Springfield].High;</strong></p>
				<p>or</p>
				<p><strong>var high = data.Springfield.High;</strong></p>
				<p>or&nbsp;assume that the value of Springfield had been stored in a variable, (e.g. var cityName), that too can be used in the array structure (but <b>NOT</b>&nbsp;with the dot notation structure):</p>
				<p><strong>var high = data[cityName].High;</strong></p>
				<h2>Moving On</h2>
				<p>One or more of these items will be useful in the next activity and in the assessment.</p>
