				<h1 class="activity ponder reflection">Mobile Compare and Contrast Assignment</h1>

				<p class="callout"><strong>Note</strong>: You should have completed the <a href="mobile_day.html" title="Review the mobile browsing assignment" target="_blank">24 hour mobile browsing experience</a> prior to undertaking this assessment and completed the assigned readings for this week.</p>

				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<div>You were asked to keep track of web sites that did a good job and those that didn't do so well as you spent your time browsing the web on your mobile device. Now I want you to start explaining the good and the bad.</div>
				<h2>Requirements</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Develop a web page that you will post to your web site in the homework directory. You may <a href="mobile_compare_template.html.zip" title="Download and unzip the template" target="_blank">use this template file</a> if you wish.</li>
					<li>There should be two sections &mdash; one for the good and one for the bad.</li>
					<li>Pick a web site that you believe provided a good visitor experience and list it in the good section.</li>
					<li>Pick a web site that you believe provided a poor visitor experience and list it in the bad section.</li>
					<li>In each section, list the site by name and provide the URL to the site.</li>
					<li>For each site explain how the site did or did not do the following:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Allow you to find the content you were looking for</li>
						<li>Allow you to read the text, view the images or media associated with the text</li>
						<li>How the navigation helped you move through the site</li>
						<li>How the colors and layout of the content enhanced or distracted the content you were consuming</li>
						<li>Offer a personal statement of likes or dislikes for the site and explain why</li>
					</ol>
					<li>For the good site provide a screenshot of a page you think did a great job.</li>
					<li>For the bad site provide a screenshot of a page that failed.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Save the file as a web page into your web site in a folder specifically for homework (you should already have this directory (folder). If you don't, create it - remember the naming rules).</li>
					<li>Upload the file and the folder to your production web site.</li>
					<li>Add a link to the file in the temporary home page of your web site.</li>
					<li>Upload the changed temporary home page to your web site.</li>
					<li>Open your home page in a browser and make sure the link to the comparison file works.</li>
					<ol>
						<li>If the link doesn't work, do some troubleshooting or get help until it does.</li>
					</ol>
				</ol>

				<h2 class="activity teach peerFeedback">Peer Review</h2>
				<p>After you post the page to your website, post a link to your page to the collaboration board in this week's module.</p>
				<p>In addition to posting your link, you need to view, review and give feedback to those in your learning group.</p>
				<div class="callout">
					<p><strong>Assignment Grade Breakdown (5 points total - Objective 3)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Link posted to collaboration board - 2 points</li>
						<li>Responded to your group members - 3 points</li>
					</ul>
