				<h1>Current Location Page</h1>
				<hr>
				<h2>Work With a Partner or Group</h2>
				<p class="callout">You are required to work with a partner or group (maximum of 5) for this assessment. Each person is responsible for her or his own work, but you should collaborate to assist one another to complete the assessment.</p>
				<h2>List Who You Worked With</h2>
				<p>In the index page of the folder you will download below you will find a comment between the "head" and "body" elements for you to list who you worked with. List all names in the comment, with your name first. These should be members of our class!</p>

				<h2>Get the Seed Code</h2>
				<p>Below is a link for you to download seed code to use for this assessment.</p>
				<p class="callout"><a href="../downloads/jsonweather.zip" target="_blank" title="opens in a new tab">jsonweather.zip</a></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Once downloaded, unzip the file and move the "jsonweather" folder to the root (typically htdocs) of your local web site.</li>
					<li>Open the folder and become familiar with the files that are included.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Get The Data</h2>
				<p>All code for this assessment will be written only in the remote_wu.js file, no other code will be allowed with the exception of custom CSS as explained in step 8.3 below!</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You will probably want to review the Weather Underground links provided in the <a href="wu_api.html" target="_blank" title="Open the weather underground API activity page">Weather Underground API activity</a> as they indicate <b>How</b> to request data and the <b>Type</b> of data that you will need.</li>
					<li>Use the jQuery $.ajax method which begins on line 24 and currently ends on line 34.</li>
					<li>Write all code within this method, add new lines within the method as need.</li>
					<li>Send the URL to the weather underground API requesting both the geolocation and conditions objects. Use the method that allows you to send in the latitude and longitude for the current location. Don't forget to include your API key as required in the URL.
						<ol>
							<li>The latitude (lat) and longitude (long) were gotten for you on lines 9 and 10.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>The dataType needed will be "jsonp".</li>
					<li>Write a success function and store its parameter as "data".</li>
					<li>I strongly encourage you to use console.log often to see what you are getting back from the API and your own variables.</li>
					<li>Base Data:
						<ol>
							<li>You are to get the city and state and combine them into a single location name separated by a comma and space. The name is to be displayed (using a jQuery selector) in the h1 element with an id of cityDisplay <b>AND</b> as the first item in the "title" element within the "head" element of the page (do not replace what's there, add this in front of what's already there).</li>
							<li>You are to get the current temperature and display it into the li with an id of currentTemp. Make sure you use JavaScript to round the number to the closest integer and display the degree symbol following the number.</li>
							<li>Finally, you are to display a summary of the current conditions in the li with an id of summary. Be sure the text starts with a capital letter (Hint: use the weather property from the current_observation object).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Additional Data:
						<ol>
							<li>You are to add a minimum of two additional data points to the weather page.
								<ol>
									<li>Three list items are provided in the index page, each with an id of "add1", "add2" and "add3" for your use.</li>
									<li>Be sure that whatever you add makes sense from the site visitors perspective, don't make them guess what you meant - make it clear and obvious!</li>
									<li>You may alter the CSS within the user_styles.css file to style this content if needed (this file is already set to be used, you don't need to do anything with the main stylesheet).</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Thoroughly Test</h2>
				<p>Make sure you thoroughly test the page on your local system to insure that all data works and is clearly visible as you intend it to be on all screen sizes. Test using the Chrome developer tools and device emulators.</p>
				<h2>Change the jQuery library</h2>
				<p>As with last week's work, the index page uses a local version of the jQuery library.</p>
				<p>Prior to uploading this to your production server, switch the local version to a CDN distributed version of jQuery 3.x.</p>
				<h2>Add the Collaboration List</h2>
				<p>Add the names of the people that you collaborated with to the comment in the index page (between the head and body elements prior to uploading.</p>
				<h2>Create a Link</h2>
				<p>On your temporary home page, create a link to the index page within the jsonweather folder.</p>
				<p>Upload the altered temporary home page and the entire jsonweather folder.</p>
				<h2>Remote Testing</h2>
				<p>Thoroughly test the links and operation of your code on the production server.</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> As of version 50, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/04/geolocation-on-secure-contexts-only?hl=en" title="Click to read more about Google's decision" target="_blank">Chrome browser does not support the geoLocation javascript function</a> unless the domain is a secured domain using the https protocol! Our web sites do not use https. The easiest solution is to test your page using a different browser (FireFox, Safari, Opera) instead of using Chrome.</p>
				<h2>Post to the Collaboration Board</h2>
				<p>You were asked to track your time this week to complete all preparations, activities and this assessment. Please post the number of hours spent to this week's collaboration board.</p>
