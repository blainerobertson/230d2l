				<h1>Mobile Weather Page</h1>
				<p>Last week you produced some sketches of a web page related to weather. This week you will build the web page for the mobile screen as you sketched it. I strongly encourage you to work together to do this, so you can share understanding, ideas and ask questions and solicit feedback during the construction.</p>
				<p>Your web page should do the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Be constructed entirely in HTML</li>
					<li>The HTML should use semantic, structural elements</li>
					<li>The HTML5 should be valid</li>
					<li>Focus entirely on its rendering on mobile screens</li>
					<li>Include all temperature-related data (except for the hourly temperatures) for the city of Franklin from the weather.json file</li>
					<li>Include an image that is related to the weather summary statement found in the weather.json file for Franklin</li>
					<li>Include navigation items (they do not need to work) for all three cities found in the weather.json file</li>
					<li>Include the mobile sketch for the weather page that you produced last week.</li>
					<li>Create a link to the external stylesheet in the &lt;head&gt; of this page to allow the CSS to affect the appearance of the html page.</li>
				</ul>
				<h1>Styling the Weather Page</h1>
				<h2>Using CSS</h2>
				<p>This week has been a whirlwind week of jumping into CSS. You have read a chapter and watched (and hopefully followed along) with a video course on how CSS works and is applied to a web page.</p>
				<h2>The Mobile Web Page</h2>
				<p>Prior to undertaking the task of styling the mobile web page and the content in it, you must first have built it. Make sure the is already done before starting this styling task.</p>
				<h2>Styling the Page</h2>
				<p>We are starting pretty basic with this styling task. No need to get fancy yet. Your primary tasks are listed below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Make good use of the web design principles (PARC and Typography) covered previously.</li>
					<li>Implement some of the techniques from the good mobile examples that you wrote about to guide what you do.</li>
					<li>The styling should follow your sketch for mobile size screens from last week.</li>
					<li>Use an external CSS file, that you create and write the code for, to style the mobile weather page.</li>
					<li>Ensure that you use appropriate font sizes and colors to allow easy readability.</li>
					<li>Use colors to enhance the message of a sunny day in Franklin and that work well with the image.</li>
					<li>The navigation items are easy to identify and reach, but unobtrusive.</li>
					<li>The CSS must be valid CSS level 3.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Submitting</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The weather page will be uploaded to your remote hosting site.</li>
					<li>Add a link to the weather page in your temporary home page.</li>
					<li>The stylesheet should be linked to the weather page using a &lt;link&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; of the weather page.</li>
					<li>The stylesheet, weather page and all images must be uploaded to the remote server.</li>
					<li>Once everything is uploaded, open your site using the 230 Student Site List and test everything to make sure it is working. The testing should also be done using a mobile device!</li>
					<li>If things do not work, troubleshoot and work with it until it does. Get help if needed.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
