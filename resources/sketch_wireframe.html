				<p>Before we ever write a single line of html it is necessary to know what you want to build. A simple layout diagram, sometimes referred to as a wireframe, can help. These diagrams can be produced on paper or electronically. For this exercise I encourage you to use paper. Why? you may ask. The answer is pretty straight forward, "It's cheap and easy."</p>

				<p>Keep in mind that these are simple. No actual content is included, just representations of content or containers for content. <b>But it needs to be more than a square that says, "content".</b> The 5 minute video below does a good job of helping you to get the idea. Watch it now:</p>

				<h2>Templates to Help</h2>
				<p>When you create your own sketches it can be easier if you have something to help you see the size limitations you may be working with. You can&nbsp;<a href="../downloads/templates.zip" title="Download a zip file of device templates" target="_blank">download a zip file</a> that contains a variety of templates for mobile and large screen devices. You do not have to use them all, rather you can pick and choose from the available templates. Print the one(s) you want to use and sketch away. Keep in mind that the exercise due this weekend requires sketches for one small screen, one medium and one large screen device.</p>
