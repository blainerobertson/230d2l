				<h1>Responsive Design</h1>
				<p>Last week you built a web page to display weather data for the city of Franklin. In addition, you wrote CSS to add visual appeal to the web page. But, all of the markup and styling was specific to a small screen device. This week you are to add CSS3 Media Queries to isolate the styling for medium and large screen devices.</p>
				<h2>Mobile First</h2>
				<p>The default styling that exists outside of media queries should accomplish two tasks:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Provide default styling for all screen sizes (font type, color scheme, etc...).</li>
					<li>Provide specific layout styling for small screens.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Adapting Layout and Styling for Larger Screens</h2>
				<p>You should write a minimum of two media queries:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Medium screens - typically these would be tablet type devices</li>
					<li>Large screens - typically these would be laptop / desktop devices</li>
				</ol>
				<p>However, while not required for this assessment, you may want to think about and possibly play with very large screens (4k and 5k monitors). These high density screens provide their own challenges for displaying content.</p>
				<h2>Use Your Wireframe Sketches</h2>
				<p>In week 4 you were to produce 3 wireframe sketches. This week you are to add media queries (mentioned above) and then add CSS code to the media queries to cause the Franklin weather data to display in all screen sizes according to the layout shown in your wireframe sketches.</p>
				<p>The wireframe sketches for all three devices must be included at the bottom of the Franklin weather page (just above the page footer) as reference when the page is being reviewed for matching your design plan.</p>
				<h2>Include the ViewPort Meta Element</h2>
				<p>In case you missed it in this week's readings, make sure to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">read about the viewport meta element</a> and include it in the head section of the Franklin web page.</p>

				<h2>Add the Hourly Temperature Data</h2>
				<p>Add the hourly weather data for the city of Franklin to the Franklin weather page from the weather.json file. <strong>But, only display the data on medium or large screen devices.</strong></p>
				<h2>Submission</h2>
				<p>The revised Franklin weather page and CSS stylesheet used to style the Franklin page will replace the files from last week. They should be accessed using the same link that should already exist in your temporary home page. Be sure to test that the new versions appear once the files are uploaded to your web site. It is recommended that you test on a variety of devices.</p>
				<h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
				<p>Objectives 1 and 2 are assessed in this week's work.</p>
