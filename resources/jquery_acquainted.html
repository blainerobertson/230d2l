				<h1>jQuery.com: Get Acquainted</h1>
				<hr />
				<h2>What is jQuery?</h2>
				<p>jQuery is a JavaScript library. A library is a collection of pre-built functionality that we, as users, can make use of without having to write it ourselves. Just like real life, we can buy or borrow tools to perform a task (e.g. a hammer to drive a nail, a kleenex to blow our nose, a pencil to write). We don't have to make the hammer, the kleenex or the pencil ourselves.</p>
				<p>However, when using any library that someone else has built we have to learn something about how it was built so we know how to use it. Think about getting into a car that you have never driven before. You usually take a minute to figure out where the button is to turn on the lights, the wiper blades, the radio controls, how to adjust the seat, etc... Why? Because you want to know how to so when you need to use them, you are prepared.</p>
				<h2>Same Reason</h2>
				<p>Just like the car example above, we need to become familiar with jQuery and the best way to do that is to take a look at the official site, where all the capabilities and functionality of the library are explained. As of June 2016 the current, stable version of jQuery is 3.0.0, that is the version you should work with.</p>
				<h2>jQuery.com</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Click <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">jQuery.com</a> and the site should open in a new browser tab or window.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>The Learning Center</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>On the right you will see a submenu with a number of options. Begin by clicking on the "jQuery Learning Center" link.
					</li>
					<li>Once there find and click the "Using jQuery Core" link. This area is the basic use of jQuery and has overlap with the jQuery Basics video course which is also part of this week.
					</li>
					<li>Try clicking several of the options that look interesting to you. The goal is not to master any of these today, rather it is to become familiar with where you can go to learn when needed.
					</li>
					<li>Be sure to check out the "Frequently Asked Questions" section at the bottom of the page!
					</li>
					<li>When you are done, return to the jQuery.com home page.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>API Documentation</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>On the home page, find and click the API Documentation link in the nav bar just below the logo.</li>
					<li>On the left is a list of the various categories of functions (tools or processes) that jQuery provides.</li>
					<li>Click "Core". In the page that opens is a list of specific functions related to using the "core" of jQuery. Look down through the page. You will find requirements, examples and explanations of how to use these various functions.</li>
					<li>Find one or two other category names on the left and click them.</li>
					<li>As with the "core" functions, click on the various functions found in the pages that you view to read the documentation and see the example code.</li>
					<li>As with the learning center, this is where you will go to see the "official" use of these tools.</li>
					<li>Other sites may help, but it <b>ALWAYS</b> as good idea to know where to find the official documentation if you need to refer to it.</li>
					<li>When done, return to the jQuery home page.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>The Goal</h2>
				<p>The goal of this activity was to become familiar with how to use jQuery.com to find tutorials and the official documentation. We will also use the site in the next activity to install jQuery into our web pages.</p>

				<p class="callout"><i><b>Note:</b>&nbsp; JavaScript and jQuery are very powerful but sometimes confusing. You are strongly encouraged to work together in your learning team to assist one another as you work on the activities and assessments mentioned in this and all lessons!</i></p>
