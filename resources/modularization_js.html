        <h1>Modularization</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Have you ever noticed that when you visit a website and move from page to page that there are certain areas on the page that don't change. To see what I mean let's visit subway.com (<a href="//subway.com" title="Refer to the Subway corporate site">http://subway.com</a>). Click around in the subway site. On each page scroll up and down and look for those parts of each page that don't really change. What did you find? If you said the top (header) and bottom (footer) you are very observant. These common parts are highlighted in figure 1:</p>

        </figure>
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>It is these common parts of a web page that can be reused. We call snippets of code that make up these reusable sections of the web page "modules" and the process of implementing them into the page "modularization". The benefits of modularizing our websites is to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Save time</b>&nbsp;- when we build modules of common code we only have to do it once. This means less time writing the same code again and again.</li>
          <li><b>Easy maintenance</b>&nbsp;- By having this common code stored off in a module, when it comes time to make a change to existing code, add new code or delete code, we only have to do it once for it to take effect throughout all the pages that use it.</li>
          <li><b>Save Money</b>&nbsp;- whether you're building a web site for yourself or someone else, the less time you have to spend building and maintaining it means less time and expense doing so. In business terms, it is being efficient.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Modules</h2>
        <p>You may be inclined to ask, "What exactly is a module?" The answer is, "A small amount of code, not stand-alone, that can be plugged-in to a larger collection of code in order to carry out or serve a particular task". Going back to Subway.com's header, you will notice that on the left is the logo, in the top right corner is a link to their international web site, to the left of the link are various tools, and at the bottom of the header is the main navigation bar. If you were to look at the source code for any of the pages you would find that the code used to build the header is about 100 lines long (alot of that is for the drop-down menus). But if you were to copy that code and paste it on a page of its own, it would look pretty strange. It is not meant to be used in that way, it is meant to be used at the top of each web page to add specific functionality to the page as a whole.</p>
        <p>A simplified header example might lead us to create a code snippet that looks like this:</p>
        <p class="callout"><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;a href="/" title="Go to the subway.com home page"&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;img src="/images/subway-logo.jpeg" alt="subway.com logo"&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;div id="tools"&gt; ... code for various tools goes here ... &lt;/div&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;nav id="page-nav"&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ul&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/sandwiches"&gt;Sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/ingredients"&gt;Ingredients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/catering"&gt;Catering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/nutrition"&gt;Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/locations"&gt;Locations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/careers"&gt;Careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/about"&gt;About Subway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/nav&gt;</code></p>
        <p>This code would be saved into a new text file, nothing else in the file except this code and given an appropriate name (e.g. header.html). The header.html file would be stored in a folder with other modules, so the storage folder could be named "modules" or something similar.</p>

        <h2>Implementing the Module</h2>
        <p>Having planned out and constructed the individual modules its now time to put them to use. In our example we will be using a JavaScript library known as JQuery along with some code of our own. Remember that the module is "plugged-in" to a larger collection of code (the web page). In our example we will instruct JavaScript to "load" the module into the &lt;header&gt; of the web page. See the example code segment under <strong><a href="#result" title="See the result">The Result</a></strong> below.</p>
        <h3>The header element</h3>

        </figure>
        <h3>The script elements</h3>
        <p>The following script elements would be inserted below the footer, but before the closing body tag.</p>
        <figure class="callout"><code>
                <b>&lt;/footer&gt;<br>
                  &lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js" integrity="sha256-cCueBR6CsyA4/9szpPfrX3s49M9vUU5BgtiJj06wt/s="   crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
                &lt;script src="modules.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
                  &lt;/body&gt;</b></code>
          <figcaption>Figure 4: The JavaScript references.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>The modules.js file</h3>
        <figure class="callout"><code><b>
          $(function() {<br>
          $("#page-header").load("header.html");<br>
          });
          </b></code>
          <figcaption>Figure 5: The JavaScript code to load the header module</figcaption></figure>
        <h3>An explanation of the code:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>&lt;header id="page-header"&gt;&lt;/header&gt;</b>&nbsp;- this a the html header element. It has been uniquely identified by adding an id attribute to it.</li>
          <li><b>&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js" integrity="sha256-cCueBR6CsyA4/9szpPfrX3s49M9vUU5BgtiJj06wt/s="   crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b>&nbsp;- this is a request to get the jQuery library directly from the jquery.com web site. It is referenced using the "src" attribute of the script element. The other components are for security and delivery purposes.</li>
          <li><b>&lt;script src="modules.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</b>&nbsp;- this is a request to our own JavaScript file, stored in our own website.</li>
          <li><b>$(function() {<br>
            $("#page-header").load("header.html");<br>
            });</b>&nbsp;- This is an anonymous function that runs when the rest of the html document is finished loading. It directs the contents of the header.html file to be loaded into the container with an id of "page-header".</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="result">The Result</h2>
        <p>Since JavaScript runs in the browser, here is how all of this code would work. Someone would see a link to index.html and click it. The server would deliver the index.html file to the browser. When the browser gets to the &lt;script&gt; tags it would read the files referenced in the "src" attributes. Reading the modules.js file, the function would be run, and the contents of the header.html file would be inserted into the &lt;header&gt; element. Assuming that everything worked as it was supposed to, the header would look like this when the browser was done:</p>
        <p><code>&lt;header id="page-header"&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;a href="/" title="Go to the subway.com home page"&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;img src="/images/subway-logo.jpeg" alt="subway.com logo"&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;div id="tools"&gt; ... code for various tools goes here ... &lt;/div&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;nav id="page_nav"&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;ul&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Ingredients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Catering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Locations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;About Subway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/ul&gt;
          <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/nav&gt;
          <br>&lt;/header&gt;</code></p>

        <h2>Make a Change</h2>
        <p>Reflect back on the list of benefits of modularization. Let's suppose that the folks at Subway decide to make soup a big part of their menu. Wow, we need to update that list of items in the navigation list. No problem. You open the header.html module and add the following code to the unordered list:&nbsp;<code><i>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/soup"&gt;Soups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</i></code>.</p>
        <p>Save the file and upload it to your website. Viola! You now have a soup navigation menu item throughout your website - even if the site had 10,000 pages. Pretty Cool, huh?!</p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Modularization is a great technique for writing and storing small collections of code that represent reusable portions of a website into external files. Those files are then included using JavaScript or some other scripting language. The resulting file is then delivered to the requesting user-agent (usually a web browser) in its finished form, leaving no evidence of the scripting language. The key is to use modules with those portions of a webpage that stay the same from page to page to page. Using this technique saves time in both construction and maintenance and money.</p>
        <h2>Application</h2>
        <p>As you prepare to build web pages, it is helpful to build a template(s). A template is simply a standard page (without content) that can be reused when a new content page is needed. The template(s) should include semantic structures with modularized common content as discussed in this activity. Use the steps outlined in this article to do so. Then, be sure to test it on the actual web server to insure that things are working as they should.</p>
