				<h1>jQuery: Assessment</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>The purpose of this week was to get you familiar with basic JavaScript concepts and implementing the jQuery library. As stated earlier it was not to turn you into a jQuery ninja in one week. However, you have been asked to watch a series of videos and follow along with them to gain actual experience writing and using jQuery and build muscle memory while gaining the experience.</p>

				<h2>Assessment</h2>
				<p>When done following along with the videos and finishing the code of the individual video files, you are to alter the Lesson4 folder and its files by:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Modifying the folder name to meet the web naming rules.</li>
					<li>Comment out the script tags in all html pages that refer to the local version of jQuery.</li>
					<li>Create a script tag that uses the path found in the cdn.txt file located in the "js" folder in each html page. (Refer to the <a href="jquery_adding.html" title="Open in  a new tab" target="_blank">jQuery: Adding to a web page</a> activity if you need a refresher)</li>
					<li>Create links to the other html pages in the Lesson4 folder in the footer of the index.htm file of the Lesson4 folder.</li>
					<li>Upload the completed "Lesson4" folder to your web site.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Submission</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Create a link to the index page of the Lesson4 folder in your own temporary home page on your web site.</li>
					<li>Upload your temporary home page with the new link added.</li>
					<li>Once everything is uploaded to your site, test all links to ensure they work!</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Grading Matrix</h2>
				<h3>Objective 6 (30 points)</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Each web page (6 total) will be checked for operation according to &nbsp;the finished behavior shown in the Lesson4 videos.</li>
					<li>Each will be graded "Complete" or not.</li>
					<li>Each page's completed behavior will be worth 5 points.</li>
				</ol>
