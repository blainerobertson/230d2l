        <h1>Greenville Weather Page</h1>
        <p>For the last several weeks you have been working with the Franklin weather page. This week you will add the Greenville weather page to the weather site.</p>
        <h2>Use the Weather.json data</h2>
        <p>As you did with the Franklin page, get the weather data from the weather.json file for the Greenville page. Use all weather-related data (not zip, longitude or latitude) for Greenville in the html page.</p>
        <h2>Valid and Semantic</h2>
        <p>Be sure to use valid and semantic (meaningful) html elements as you build the page and its data. If your feedback from previous weeks mentions changes needed in the Franklin page, make those changes.</p>
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>Make sure the navigation links on both the Franklin and Greenville weather pages are now operational for both cities. The Springfield navigation item can remain non-operational. Remember to make the navigation a integral part of the <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>.</p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Upload the revised Franklin and new Greenville weather pages and CSS stylesheet used to style them to your web site.</li>
          <li>Do <b>NOT</b> create a new link to the Greenville page on your temporary home page.</li>
          <li>Both pages will be accessed using the Franklin weather page link that should already exist in your temporary home page.</li>
          <li>The new Greenville page will be accessed via the navigation bar in the Franklin page and vice versa.</li>
          <li>Be sure to test the operation of all links, pages and CSS on a variety of devices once the files are uploaded to your web site.</li>
          <li>It is strongly recommended that you exchange formative grading, using the grading matrix below, with at least one other classmate prior to the due date. This will allow you to catch errors and fix them prior to the actual assessment. </li>
        </ol>
