				<h1>Search Engine Optimization</h1>
				<h2>What is Search Engine Optimization?</h2>
				<p>"SEO is a marketing discipline focused on growing visibility in organic (non-paid) search engine results. SEO encompasses both the technical and creative elements required to improve rankings, drive traffic, and increase awareness in search engines. There are many aspects to SEO, from the words on your page to the way other sites link to you on the web. Sometimes SEO is simply a matter of making sure your site is structured in a way that search engines understand [using semantic markup].</p>
				<p>SEO isn't just about building search engine-friendly websites. It's about making your site better for people too." (<a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">SEO: The Beginner's Guide</a>)</p>
				<h2>Follow the Guide</h2>
				<p>In this week's required readings you found a link to <a href="https://moz.com/blog/visual-guide-to-keyword-targeting-onpage-optimization" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">https://moz.com/blog/visual-guide-to-keyword-targeting-onpage-optimization</a>. Please make sure you have read the article carefully! You may even want to print it off or save it to your own computer to refer back to as you build your own project site later in the course.</p>
				<h2>Slideshow</h2>
				<p>In addition to the resources shared above, you can view <a href="https://blainerobertson.github.io/230d2l/downloads/search-engine-optimization.pdf" title="View the slideshow in a new tab" target="_blank">a PDF slide show</a> on search engine optimization.</p>
				<h2>What are your Key Words?</h2>
				<p>This activity is directly related to your <a href="../project/requirements.html" title="Review the site project requirements in a new tab" target="_blank">site project</a>. This week you are submitting a proposal and this week you are asked to consider your project content. The SEO implementation is integral to your site and its content.</p>
				<p>As you begin building your site project, consider what the site is intending to do (the purpose statement should help!) and what words convey the meaning that people would type into a search engine to find your site. Those are key words! Identify and write down a list of the top ten words you believe relate directly to your site content.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>______________________________</li>
					<li>______________________________</li>
					<li>______________________________</li>
					<li>______________________________</li>
					<li>______________________________</li>
					<li>______________________________</li>
					<li>______________________________</li>
					<li>______________________________</li>
					<li>______________________________</li>
					<li>______________________________</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Now, open your favorite search engine and type in these words. Do sites appear that match or come close to the content of your own site? If so, you probably have the right words, if not, revise the list.</p>
				<h2>Add Key Words to your Content</h2>
				<p>Later, following the guidelines provided in the blog that you read as part of this exercise build the content of your pages, adding keywords and following the other suggestions from the blog. While this will not guarantee a #1 position in the search engine results page it should help tremendously.</p>
