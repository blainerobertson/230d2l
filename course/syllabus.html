				<h1>CIT 230 -&nbsp;Web Frontend Development</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>In this course we will jump right into HTML, CSS and other web development basics. There is a lot to learn quickly. If you are new to web development, especially HTML and CSS, you might consider taking WDD 100 to help you prepare for this course. WDD 100 is not required for CIT 230, but it will help you be prepared. In addition, about 2/3 of students have had or are taking a programming course (CIT 160) - this seems to make a difference in their success.</p>

				<p class="callout">This is a technical class, not a design class. It will require between 9-12 hours per week. Even though it may be challenging, you will be successful as long as you are diligent and work hard. You are strongly encouraged to collaborate with your classmates in order to support and help one another.</p>

				<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>When building web sites, successful web developers must consider all of the following: audience, organization, interface, usability, content, layout, and visual (aesthetic) design. This course will teach you to plan, design, and construct web sites to work properly in modern web browsers and conform to web standards while following best practices.</p>
				<h2>Keys to Success</h2>
				<p>To be successful in this course you will need to have the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Strong work ethic</li>
					<li>Ability to solve problems</li>
					<li>Ability to meet deadlines</li>
					<li>Ability to work well with others &mdash; supporting, communicating, teaching, and learning from them</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Materials</h2>
				<p>To be successful in this course you&rsquo;ll need the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A computer with 8GB of RAM (recommended), 64-bit operating system, and wireless capability.</li>
					<li>A domain name (your own name is recommended) and web hosting account to be maintained throughout the semester.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Code editor &mdash; <a title="Download Brackets - link opens in a new tab" href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank">Brackets text editor</a>&nbsp;(free software for Mac and Windows).</li>
					<li>FTP client &mdash; <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/download.php">Filezilla</a> recommended (free software for Mac and Windows).</li>
					<li>SitePoint Premium annual account, cost is $10 (will be charged automatically to your school account - no need to pay anything up front) and includes books, video courses and screencasts. To sign up go to&nbsp;<a title="Sign-up for a SitePoint Premium membership - link opens in a new tab" href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/students" target="_blank">https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/students</a> and <strong>use your BYU-Idaho email address</strong>.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Hosting</h2>
				<p>Students are responsible for acquiring a domain name (your own name is recommended) and professional web hosting from a provider of their choice. Previous students have had success with these companies:&nbsp;<a href="http://stats.justhost.com/track?c31b8be21a8ea1de7516b3cb569c3210e">JustHost.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hostmonster.com/track/blainerobertson/tellmemore?page=tell_me_more.html">Hostmonster.com&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/UP/BYUI">Bluehost.com&nbsp;</a>. Each of these hosting companies provide a free domain name with purchased hosting.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Hosting must be maintained for the duration of the course, although most providers will discount prices for longer periods. You will be able to use the hosting services in other classes.</p>

				<div class="callout">
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> A hosting provider must meet the following requirements:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Linux-based</li>
						<li>Supports PHP 5.5 or greater</li>
						<li>Supports sub-domains</li>
						<li>Provides live customer support</li>
						<li>Has unlimited bandwidth</li>
						<li>Has large storage (more than 10 GB is recommended)</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
				<p>These objectives are based on web standards and best practices to help you be successful in the future.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Develop web pages that are&nbsp;<a title="Read about semantics on html5doctor.com" href="http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/" target="_blank">semantically</a>&nbsp;accurate using the HTML5 markup language.</li>
					<li>Style web pages using Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) level 3 and avoid all HTML presentational markup.</li>
					<li>Provide content that is visually appropriate, usable, and findable to humans and machines.</li>
					<li>Plan, design, and develop web pages and sites according to best practices of organization and maintainability.</li>
					<li>Work with JavaScript to handle events and interactions within the browser.</li>
					<li>Work effectively with others in a work environment by communicating clearly, fulfilling assignments and meeting deadlines.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Know, Do, Become</h2>
				<p>This course is the first step to becoming a web developer - which requires you to both know and do. In order to know something, you must study, reflect, and practice. To do requires effort and application to implement your knowledge. If you consistently do this you are on your way to becoming what you desire.</p>

				<h2>Collaboration</h2>
				<p>During this class, you are encouraged to form learning teams. These teams will be a primary resource for mutual support and feedback. Before you turn anything in, we recommend that you get feedback from your team. &nbsp;This kind of team structure is similar to what you will find in the workplace.</p>
				<p>You will start organizing your team during week 01 while you are introducing yourself to your classmates. Look for others you can collaborate with. It is vital that you coordinate schedules and identify times that you are available to meet with your peers.</p>

				<h2>Assessments</h2>
				<p>Each class assessment relates to one or more course objectives, indicated in brackets. Due dates are listed in the course schedule. Each assessment will be submitted as specified in its description. Once posted, an assessment should remain unchanged until graded, with the grade appearing in the grade book. Each assessment will be graded using the provided grading matrix. It is <b>YOUR</b> responsibility to thoroughly read and understand the specification for each assessment and test your own product for compliance to the stated criteria. Peer review, feedback and correction using the grading matrix prior to the due date is encouraged.</p>

				<h2><span>Teaching Presentation [Objectives 1, 5 &amp; 6]</span></h2>
				<div>
					<p>You will create a 7-minute <a href="/230d2l/presentations/overview.html" title="Read the overview of teaching presentations" target="_blank">teaching presentation</a> that you will share with the class. Visit <a href="/230d2l/presentations/topics.html" title="Look at the list of teaching presentations" target="_blank">Teaching Topic Presentation List&nbsp;</a>for a list of topics and guidelines on signing up. Carefully review the <a href="/230d2l/presentations/grading_matrix.html" target="_blank" title="Review the teaching presentation grading matrix">Teaching Presentation Grading Matrix</a>&nbsp;for assignment details.</p>

					<p>The presentation can be created using a presentation software like PowerPoint or Keynote, or using a web-based program like Prezi, Haiku Deck, Google Slides or something similar.</p>

					<p>After you have created your presentation, you will need to use a screencasting program like Screencast-O-Matic to record yourself narrating the presentation. After recording your screencast, you will need to post it online, add that link to your footer, and post the link to the presentation discussion board for that week.</p>

					<h2>Design Principles [3 &amp; 6]</h2>
					<p>In order to better understand design you will become familiar with four essential design principles: Proximity, Alignment, Repetition and Contrast as well as the principle of Typography. You will be responsible for identifying examples of each from the web and explaining how these concepts are being used. In addition, you will be expected to implement these concepts into your own work. For details, review the <a href="/230d2l/resources/design_principles_assessment.html" title="Review the design principles assessment" target="_blank">Design Principles Assessment</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Planning Documents [All Objectives]</h2>
					<p><q>Failure to plan is planning to fail</q>&nbsp;is a truism and not more so than in developing a web site. Over and over site designers and developers have found that by careful planning, site design and construction is faster, cheaper, and produces a better outcome.</p>
					<p>Accordingly, you will carefully and methodically produce site planning documents that describe the essential elements of&nbsp;<em>Why</em>&nbsp;(you are building the site, your purpose),&nbsp;<em>Who</em>&nbsp;(is your intended audience),&nbsp;<em>What</em>&nbsp;(do your audience members want from the site, the content),&nbsp;<em>How</em>&nbsp;(the content will be presented and organized),&nbsp;<em>When</em>&nbsp;(content will be presented or not available). To do these things you will develop a number of documents to help answer each of these items.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>Weather Site [All Objectives]</h2>
				<p>For approximately 10 weeks we will construct a weather related site in order to learn and practice building a web site using a variety of technologies. You will have set documents that you will submit for assessments. The weather site is intended to lay a foundation of skills that will then be applied to your own project.</p>

				<h2>Web Site Project [Objectives&mdash;all]</h2>
				<p>The <a href="/230d2l/project/requirements.html" title="Read the requirements for the web site project" target="_blank">Web Site Project</a> will be your major project for the course. It will require an implementation of all the skills and technologies covered by the course but on a <a href="/230d2l/project/project_proposal.html" title="Review the project proposal requirements" target="_blank">project of your own design</a>. This is a major aspect of the course and will require substantial time and effort.</p>

				<h2>Getting Help</h2>
				<p>For many students learning HTML, CSS and many of the tools and techniques of this course is equivalent to learning a foreign language. For 99% of students, it is not a matter of "if", but rather "when" you will need help. There are a number of mechanisms built into the course so you can get help. They are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Learning Teams &mdash; This is a small group of your peers, enrolled in the same class, doing the same preparations, activities and assessments. You should interact with this group frequently &mdash; ask questions, share insights, read one another&rsquo;s work, make comments and suggestions. Learn how to work together and support one another. This is a very powerful and useful model &mdash; one that is used in the web design and development industry.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Weekly Support Forums &mdash; A discussion board is where you can ask and answer questions, ask for clarification and share insights (collaborate) with your peers. This is an avenue to maintain communications outside of class. The professor and the teaching assistants will monitor the board and offer help when appropriate. However, the primary intent is for class members to help one another using this tool. Don&rsquo;t underestimate the importance of these activities to your learning.</li>
					<li>The Professor &mdash; Feel free to email your questions, or schedule a time to meet online.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Teaching Assistant &mdash; Online students are able to meet virtually with the campus TAs. &nbsp;Your instructor will provide TA contact information during the first few weeks of the class. On-campus students can drop by Smith 448 to visit with teaching assistants.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Grading</h2>
				<p>Assessments are graded by the professor or teaching assistant (TA) and a score given for one or more course objectives. Passing course objectives, not the gross percentage shown in the grade book, determines the final course grade. Read about&nbsp;<a href="/230d2l/course/grading.html" title="Link opens in a new tab" target="_blank">how to check your grade</a>&nbsp;in class.</p>
				<p>At the conclusion of the course, each course objective is graded Pass/Fail. To pass an objective, you must earn at least 80% of the points allocated to it. It is critical that you are always doing your best work, on time and error free &mdash; do not submit junk! You must follow the directions to have work graded.</p>

				<h2>Tentative Schedule</h2>
				<p>Because the course is under revision, the absolute schedule is not yet set. Tentatively, the course is divided into three general modules:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Set Up ~ 2 weeks</li>
					<li>Learning By Doing ~ 10 weeks</li>
					<li>Personal Project ~ 2 weeks</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Module 1 &mdash; Set Up</h3>
				<p>This module, as the name implies, involves getting the tools downloaded, installed and configured. It also will involve learning how to use the tools and other resources of the class and basic design principles.</p>
				<h3>Module 2 &mdash; Learning By Doing</h3>
				<p>The learning by doing module focuses on the concepts and implementation of planning a web site, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and JSON and User Experience. Along the way you will build and post a variety of web pages and other web-related documents to demonstrate proficiency and progress.</p>

				<h3>Module 3 &mdash; Personal Project</h3>
				<p>Slightly after mid-term you will <a href="/230d2l/project/project_proposal.html" title="Review the project proposal requirements" target="_blank">submit a proposal</a> to the professor where you will outline a <a href="/230d2l/project/requirements.html" title="Read the requirements for the web site project" target="_blank">Personal Web Site Project</a> you want to build. The proposal must be approved before you begin actual construction. Once approved, you will have until the final week of the semester to plan, construct and test your project.</p>

				<p>The finished project should undergo a peer review prior to it's being due the last class day of the semester. The feedback from the peer review should guide you to make modifications or revisions (as you deem appropriate) prior to the project being completed for final assessment by the professor on the last class day of the semester. Consult the Project Criteria and <a href="/230d2l/project/project_matrix.html" title="Read the grading matrix for the personal project" target="_blank">Grading Matrix</a>.</p>
