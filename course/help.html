        <h1>Getting Help</h1>
        <p>For this class there are multiple avenues of help, but keep in mind that you must have tried to solve the problem yourself prior to seeking help from others.</p>
        <p><b>Your Peers</b> - it is expected and encouraged for you to work together to help one another. Meet face-to-face, call one another, use virtual software (Skype, Google Hangouts, etc...).</p>
        <p><b>The Collaboration Boards</b> - use the weekly collaboration boards to post and answer questions related to the topic of the week.</p>
        <p><b>The Teaching Assistant</b> - contact a teaching assistant to get help and answer your questions. The teaching assistants are shown below:</p>
        <!--	Put TA Information Here  -->
        <ul>
          <li>Naomi Bastion (campus, online) &mdash; bas15012@byui.edu</li>
          <li>Joseph Canto (campus, online) &mdash; can16004@byui.edu</li>

          <li>Andrew Jester (campus, online) &mdash; jes15007@byui.edu</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: none;">If you are an online student, contact the Teaching Assistant by email. The TA will contact you within 24 hours and the two of you can arrange a meeting time and means. Contact the TA early as it takes some time to make arrangements and actually meet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>The Professor</b> - Check the Overview page for information of how to contact the professor.</p>
              <p><b>CIT Open Lab</b> is located in STC 347 (<a href="http://blainerobertson.github.io/230d2l/downloads/w17labschedule.pdf" title="View the schedule pdf in a new tab" target="_blank">view the actual schedule</a>).
